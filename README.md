# VLSI Course – Guided RTL Exercises (Verilog)

This repository contains small RTL modules completed as part of a VLSI design course.

Note: These are course-guided exercises. The specifications and base approach were provided by the course.
I am uploading them to show practice with FSM-based control logic and simulation workflow, not as original system designs.

## Projects
- Traffic Light Controller
- Parking System
- Vending Machine

Each project folder contains:
- `rtl/` Verilog module
- a short README describing expected behavior and what I learned
